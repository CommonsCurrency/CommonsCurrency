      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <p class="intro-text">Common questions about Commons Currency and how it compares to other monetary proposals and
        digital currency initiatives.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>How does Commons Currency compare to stablecoins?</h2>

      <p><strong>Short answer: Stablecoins privatize public money creation, while Commons democratizes it.</strong></p>

      <p>The 2025 U.S. Stablecoin legislation (the "GENIUS Act") exemplifies why private stablecoins are fundamentally
        the wrong solution to global monetary problems. While stablecoins claim to innovate on digital money, they
        actually represent a massive transfer of public monetary authority to private corporations.</p>

      <h3>The Problem with Stablecoins</h3>

      <h4>1. Privatization of Seigniorage</h4>

      <p><span class="highlight">Stablecoins transfer seigniorage—the profit from money creation—from the public to
          corporations like Circle and Tether.</span> These firms hold vast reserves in U.S. Treasuries, meaning
        taxpayers pay interest while issuers collect yield without risk exposure. Law & Liberty called it "the great
        stablecoin heist"—privatized money creation inconsistent with Congress's constitutional duty to coin money.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons approach:</strong> All seigniorage benefits belong to the public. When currency is issued, it's
        for public purposes through democratic governance, not private profit.</p>

      <h4>2. Outsourced Monetary Sovereignty</h4>

      <p>By legitimizing privately issued "digital dollars" while prohibiting a Fed-issued CBDC, the GENIUS Act <span
          class="highlight">outsources monetary sovereignty to corporations.</span> This cements a corporate monopoly
        over digital money, replacing "public trust in currency" with corporate credit systems.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons approach:</strong> Democratic nations collectively govern the currency through
        one-nation-one-vote. No single entity—corporate or governmental—controls it.</p>

      <h4>3. Hidden Taxpayer Subsidies</h4>

      <p>Each stablecoin dollar is backed by Treasuries paying interest—so the government effectively subsidizes issuers
        with public debt payments while users earn no yield. This is a taxpayer-funded carry trade that enriches
        intermediaries while providing no public benefit.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons approach:</strong> No intermediary extraction. The currency serves users directly, with any
        system revenues flowing to public purposes.</p>

      <h4>4. Financial Stability Risks</h4>

      <p>Circle and Tether now rank among the top 20 foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries, rivaling small sovereign
        nations. This <span class="highlight">concentrates liquidity dependence on private tech firms</span>, creating
        systemic fragilities analogous to shadow banks. If stablecoin issuers face runs, they could destabilize Treasury
        markets.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons approach:</strong> Built on public infrastructure with transparent reserves, democratic
        governance, and no single point of failure.</p>

      <h4>5. Banking Disintermediation</h4>

      <p>Banking associations warn that stablecoins could divert deposits from banks, undermining lending capacity. If
        consumers park money in stablecoins rather than deposits, the banking sector loses cheap funding for
        loans—hollowing out credit creation without offering an equivalent channel.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons approach:</strong> Works with local banking systems (see <a
          href="bonds-financial.html">Financial Services</a>), strengthening rather than replacing them.</p>

      <h4>6. Regulatory Arbitrage</h4>

      <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr warned that the Act's broad authorization of "digital asset service
        providers" enables regulatory arbitrage. Stablecoin issuers could behave like unregulated banks, reproducing
        vulnerabilities that caused early 20th-century bank panics.</p>

      <p>Foreign issuers like Tether can evade provisions by incorporating offshore (El Salvador), operating in U.S.
        markets with lighter compliance—perpetuating money laundering risks.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons approach:</strong> Transparent blockchain with coordinated global regulation, impossible to
        hide illicit activity.</p>

      <h3>Fundamental Difference</h3>

      <p><strong>Stablecoins recreate the dynamics of public money through private profit channels.</strong> They're
        pegged to the dollar, so they don't solve dollar hegemony—they entrench it while extracting value to corporate
        shareholders.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons Currency creates genuinely new public money through democratic global governance.</strong> It
        replaces dollar hegemony with a neutral international currency, eliminates intermediary extraction, and serves
        the global public interest.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Isn't this just like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?</h2>

      <p><strong>No. Bitcoin and Commons solve fundamentally different problems.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Bitcoin's vision:</strong> Apolitical, decentralized money beyond government control, with fixed supply
        enforced by code.</p>

      <p><strong>Commons vision:</strong> Democratic, governance-enabled money that serves human needs through
        collective decision-making.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Bitcoin's fixed supply makes it deflationary—great for speculation, terrible for an
          economy that needs to grow.</span> Commons enables counter-cyclical policy to maintain full employment without
        forcing austerity.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>What about Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)?</h2>

      <p>CBDCs are a step in the right direction—digital currencies issued by central banks. But they have critical
        limitations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>National only:</strong> Each CBDC is for one country. This doesn't solve international trade issues
          or dollar hegemony.</li>
        <li><strong>No coordination:</strong> Countries still compete via currency wars and trade imbalances.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveillance concerns:</strong> A national CBDC could enable mass surveillance of citizens by their
          government.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproduces power dynamics:</strong> Dollar CBDC would be even more powerful than paper dollars.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="highlight">Commons Currency ultimately aims to replace national currencies entirely, not coexist
          with them indefinitely.</span> Having multiple currencies alongside Commons undermines the core benefits: you
        still have currency speculation, competitive devaluations, and conversion friction.</p>

      <p><strong>What happens to national monetary institutions?</strong> Central banks, treasuries, and finance
        ministries don't disappear—they transform. Instead of issuing national currency, they issue Commons Units within
        their democratic quotas. Instead of managing USD or EUR reserves, they manage CU. Instead of independent
        monetary policy, they participate in coordinated global governance.</p>

      <p>National CBDCs might serve as a <strong>stepping stone</strong>—helping countries digitize their monetary
        systems and build technical capacity before full adoption. But the institutional knowledge and infrastructure
        transitions into operating within the Commons Currency framework rather than being discarded.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need a new currency? Can't we reform the current system?</h2>

      <p>Decades of reform attempts have failed because <span class="highlight">the fundamental architecture is
          unreformable.</span></p>

      <h3>Why Reform Fails</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dollar privilege is structural:</strong> The U.S. benefits too much from reserve currency status to
          give it up voluntarily.</li>
        <li><strong>IMF governance is locked:</strong> Voting power is based on economic size, and those with power
          won't cede it.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax havens are profitable:</strong> Countries compete for capital by lowering taxes—prisoner's
          dilemma with no exit.</li>
        <li><strong>No enforcement mechanism:</strong> International agreements are voluntary and easily ignored.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Just as the Articles of Confederation couldn't be reformed into a functional U.S. government (requiring a new
        Constitution), the Bretton Woods system can't be reformed into a just global monetary order—it requires
        replacement.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Won't powerful countries block this?</h2>

      <p><strong>Initially, perhaps. But network effects favor adoption.</strong></p>

      <p>It doesn't require all 200+ countries to join at once. Start with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deficit countries:</strong> Those hurt by current system (most of Global South)</li>
        <li><strong>Regional blocs:</strong> ASEAN, African Union, Latin American countries</li>
        <li><strong>Trade partners:</strong> China-Russia, EU-Africa corridors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As the network grows, the benefits compound:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Larger trading network → more utility</li>
        <li>Deeper liquidity → easier large transactions</li>
        <li>Proven stability → more trust</li>
        <li>Eventually even the U.S. faces: join or be isolated from most of global trade</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Historical parallel: When the U.S. dollar replaced gold standard, it didn't happen overnight. It took decades
        of gradual adoption driven by superior utility.</p>

      <h2>How is this different from the IMF's SDRs (Special Drawing Rights)?</h2>

      <p>SDRs were Keynes's bancor proposal watered down to the point of uselessness.</p>

      <p>SDRs are a reserve asset, not a currency. You can't buy coffee with SDRs. Commons is designed to be an actual
        medium of exchange.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>What happens to national currencies?</h2>

      <p><span class="highlight">The end goal is for Commons to become the sole global currency, replacing national
          currencies entirely.</span> This is how you truly eliminate currency speculation, competitive devaluations,
        and conversion friction.</p>

      <p><strong>However, transition will be gradual and voluntary:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase 1 - International Only:</strong> Countries start by using Commons for cross-border trade and
          settlements while maintaining local currency domestically. <em>This reduces risk during early adoption.</em>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2 - Increasing Domestic Use:</strong> As confidence builds, Commons naturally expands into
          domestic transactions (wages, retail, etc.). Local currency and Commons coexist.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3 - Full Adoption:</strong> Countries retire national currencies, operating entirely in
          Commons. <em>This is where full benefits are realized.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> This could take 10-30 years. Some countries (especially those with weak/volatile
        currencies) may adopt quickly. Others may take longer. But the direction should be clear: <span
          class="highlight">one world, one currency.</span></p>

      <p><strong>Why full adoption is the goal:</strong> Maintaining multiple currencies defeats the purpose. You still
        have forex speculation, currency crises, competitive devaluations, and conversion costs. The system only
        achieves its full potential when Commons is universal.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>How do you prevent inflation?</h2>

      <p><span class="highlight">The most important mechanism: Commons Currency assesses inflationary impact BEFORE creating money, not after.</span> This predictive approach prevents inflation rather than merely reacting to it.</p>

      <p>Multiple layers of protection work together:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Proactive modeling:</strong> Every issuance proposal undergoes economic analysis to predict its effect on inflation. Can the real economy absorb this new purchasing power? Are there idle resources (unemployed workers, unused capacity) that can be mobilized?</li>
        <li><strong>Quota limits:</strong> Countries can't print unlimited currency (see <a
            href="currency-issuance.html">Currency Issuance</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Real resource backing:</strong> Quotas based on productive capacity, not arbitrary numbers</li>
        <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> Removes excess currency from circulation if inflation appears (see <a href="taxation.html">Global Tax
            Coordination</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Democratic monitoring:</strong> Assembly adjusts rules based on economic conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent data:</strong> Real-time monitoring and early warning systems on blockchain</li>
      </ol>

      <p><span class="highlight">Key insight: Inflation happens when currency creation exceeds real productive
          capacity.</span> Commons ties issuance to economic fundamentals, models impact beforehand, and uses taxation for fine-tuning when needed.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Won't this enable surveillance of all transactions?</h2>

      <p><strong>No. Privacy is built-in by design.</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Individual accounts are private:</strong> Optional shielded transactions using zero-knowledge proofs
        </li>
        <li><strong>National accounts are transparent:</strong> Government spending is auditable to prevent corruption
        </li>
        <li><strong>Selective disclosure:</strong> Prove facts without revealing details (e.g., creditworthiness without
          showing full history)</li>
        <li><strong>No central authority:</strong> Distributed governance prevents single entity from surveilling</li>
      </ul>

      <p>See <a href="privacy-security.html">Privacy & Security</a> for technical details on how this is achieved.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>What about countries that don't have internet access or technical infrastructure?</h2>

      <p>Commons is designed for universal accessibility:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mobile-first:</strong> Works on basic smartphones via apps</li>
        <li><strong>SMS fallback:</strong> Can transact via text message without smartphone</li>
        <li><strong>Local agents:</strong> Community banks and shops can serve as access points</li>
        <li><strong>Offline capability:</strong> Transactions can be queued and settled when connection available</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure investment:</strong> Surplus recycling funds connectivity projects</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many Africans leapfrogged landlines straight to mobile money (M-Pesa). Similarly, Commons can leapfrog
        traditional banking infrastructure.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>How do you bootstrap a new currency? Won't it have no value initially?</h2>

      <p><strong>This is where taxation is critical (see <a href="taxation.html">Global Tax Coordination</a>).</strong>
      </p>

      <p>When member nations require taxes to be paid in Commons Units, this creates immediate inherent demand. Everyone
        in those countries needs CU to fulfill their legal tax obligations, establishing a floor value.</p>

      <p>Additionally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Government spending:</strong> Countries pay salaries, contracts in CU</li>
        <li><strong>Trade facilitation:</strong> Lower friction than current systems drives adoption</li>
        <li><strong>Network effects:</strong> Value grows as more users join</li>
        <li><strong>Stable backing:</strong> Backed by real economies, not speculation</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Isn't one-nation-one-vote unfair? Shouldn't larger economies have more say?</h2>

      <p><strong>That's the current IMF system, and it's precisely the problem.</strong></p>

      <p>The IMF's weighted voting gives the U.S. effective veto power and lets rich nations impose conditions on poor
        ones. This is monetary imperialism, not cooperation.</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">One-nation-one-vote is the foundation of international democracy.</span> At the UN
        General Assembly, Liechtenstein and China each have one vote. Same principle applies here.</p>

      <p>Safeguards against abuse:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supermajority requirements (e.g., 2/3) for major decisions</li>
        <li>Quotas scaled to economic size (so large economies can issue more, appropriately)</li>
        <li>Transparent rules preventing reckless behavior</li>
        <li>Exit rights if system becomes unworkable</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>How long would this take to implement?</h2>

      <p>Realistically, <strong>5-10 years from serious commitment to operational system.</strong></p>

      <p>See <a href="implementation.html">Implementation Roadmap</a> for phased approach:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Years 1-2:</strong> Design refinement, treaty negotiation, consensus building</li>
        <li><strong>Years 2-4:</strong> Testnet launch, pilot programs with 10-20 countries</li>
        <li><strong>Years 4-7:</strong> Gradual production launch, incremental nation onboarding</li>
        <li><strong>Years 7-10:</strong> Mature system with majority of global trade</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For comparison, the Euro took nearly a decade from Maastricht Treaty (1992) to physical currency (2002).
        Commons is more ambitious but also has more urgent need.</p>

      <h2>Who is behind this proposal?</h2>

      <p>Currently, Commons Currency is an open proposal seeking input from economists, technologists, policymakers, and
        citizens globally. It synthesizes ideas from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>John Maynard Keynes:</strong> Bancor proposal (1944) and symmetric trade adjustment mechanisms</li>
        <li><strong>Heterodox Post-Keynesian Economics:</strong> Endogenous money creation, stock-flow consistent
          modeling, institutional analysis, and rejection of neoclassical equilibrium assumptions. Thinkers like Hyman
          Minsky (financial instability hypothesis), Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Wynne Godley, Steve Keen (debt
          dynamics and mathematical modeling of instability), and other contemporary
          theorists.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT):</strong> Taxation drives currency demand (chartalism), functional
          finance (Abba Lerner), sovereign currency issuer vs. user distinction. Work of Stephanie Kelton, Warren
          Mosler, Bill Mitchell, Randall Wray.</li>
        <li><strong>Baha'i Faith principles:</strong> The vision of a single world currency as part of global unity and
          collective security. The Baha'i writings have advocated since the 19th century for universal institutions
          including an international auxiliary language and a universal currency to eliminate economic barriers and
          foster cooperation among nations.</li>
        <li><strong>Democratic governance theory:</strong> One-nation-one-vote, supermajority consensus, transparent
          accountability</li>
        <li><strong>Contemporary blockchain technology:</strong> Byzantine Fault Tolerance, zero-knowledge proofs, smart
          contracts, high-performance architectures</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="highlight">The intellectual foundation combines heterodox post-Keynesian economic thinking with a
          spiritual vision of global unity.</span> The economic tradition emphasizes real-world institutional dynamics
        over abstract market equilibria, recognizing that money is endogenous (created by credit), economies are
        inherently uncertain, and power relations
        matter. The spiritual tradition recognizes that humanity's path toward maturity requires transcending narrow
        nationalism and building institutions that serve our common welfare.</p>

      <p>The goal is to build a broad coalition—not owned by any single entity but governed collectively by
        participating nations.</p>
