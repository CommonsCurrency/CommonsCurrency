      <h1>Commons Currency Proposals</h1>

      <p class="intro-text" style="text-align: center; max-width: 700px; margin: 2rem auto 3rem;">
        Comprehensive technical and economic architecture for a democratically governed global monetary system.
        Explore each section to understand how Commons Currency addresses the fundamental challenges of international
        finance.
      </p>

      <h2>Economic Architecture</h2>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="understanding-money.html">Understanding Money: How It Really Works →</a></h3>
        <p><strong>Start here if you're new to monetary economics.</strong> Learn the fundamentals of how money is
          actually created, what gives it value, and why common misconceptions lead to harmful policies like unnecessary
          austerity. Essential reading for understanding why Commons Currency is designed the way it is.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="bitcoin-critique.html">Why Bitcoin Is Not Money →</a></h3>
        <p>A comprehensive analysis of why Bitcoin fundamentally fails as money, cannot solve real economic problems,
          and
          why its deflationary design would cause economic harm. Explains the three functions of money and why Bitcoin
          fails at each, its lack of governance, environmental catastrophe, and what actual monetary problems it
          ignores.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="economic-overview.html">Economic Overview →</a></h3>
        <p>High-level economic principles and the synthesis of democratic governance
          with fiscal coordination. Understand the crisis of current systems and how Commons addresses persistent trade
          imbalances, reserve currency hegemony, and asymmetric adjustment burdens.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="governance.html">Democratic Governance →</a></h3>
        <p>One-nation-one-vote governance structure, validator nodes, Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus, and the
          democratic assembly voting mechanisms that prevent capture by powerful economies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="currency-issuance.html">Currency Issuance & Distribution →</a></h3>
        <p>Genesis allocation to nations, late-joiner fairness mechanisms through proportional adjustment, national
          issuance rights with democratic guardrails, and the principles ensuring no country is diluted or left behind.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="taxation.html">Global Tax Coordination →</a></h3>
        <p>How taxation drives currency demand, controls inflation without austerity, eliminates tax
          havens through coordinated minimums, and ends the race to the bottom that enables capital to evade its
          obligations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="trade-rebalancing.html">Automatic Trade Rebalancing →</a></h3>
        <p>Bancor-inspired symmetric adjustment mechanisms, surplus recycling into deficit countries, automatic
          investment funds, and how Commons prevents persistent imbalances without forcing austerity on struggling
          economies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="blockchain-tech.html">Blockchain Infrastructure →</a></h3>
        <p>Comprehensive technical specification: BFT consensus protocol details, parallel transaction execution,
          block and transaction structure, state machine design, cryptographic primitives (EdDSA, BLS, zk-SNARKs),
          storage architecture, security layers, network upgrades, and node operations. Deep dive into the technical
          architecture powering a global monetary system.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="identity-credit.html">Identity & Decentralized Credit →</a></h3>
        <p>Proof of personhood, zero-knowledge creditworthiness proofs, how the system enables unsecured lending without
          over-collateralization while preserving privacy. The breakthrough that makes decentralized credit possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="bonds-financial.html">Bonds & Financial Services →</a></h3>
        <p>Why bonds exist for coordination rather than funding, payments and remittances, local banking integration,
          community banks, and the full spectrum of financial services enabled by Commons.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Cross-Cutting Concerns</h2>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="privacy-security.html">Privacy & Security →</a></h3>
        <p>Multi-layered privacy architecture, zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure, national transparency
          with individual privacy, regulatory compliance mechanisms, and data protection principles.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="implementation.html">Implementation Roadmap →</a></h3>
        <p>Phased approach from design to global adoption, testnet pilots, gradual nation onboarding, transition paths,
          and how existing currencies can run parallel during the shift to Commons.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-section">
        <h3><a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions →</a></h3>
        <p>Common questions about Commons Currency including detailed comparisons to stablecoins, Bitcoin, CBDCs, and
          SDRs. Learn why the GENIUS Act's approach fails and how Commons differs fundamentally from other digital
          currency proposals.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>

      <p>These proposals are living documents meant to evolve through democratic participation and collaborative
        refinement. The world we're building requires contributions from all humanity—not just experts, but anyone who
        cares deeply about creating a more just economic future.</p>

      <p><strong>As automation and AI reshape the economy, millions are questioning their economic future.</strong> If
        that includes you—whether you're facing job displacement, worried about your industry, or frustrated watching
        opportunities disappear—this is your chance to help build the alternative. Not as a victim of economic change,
        but as an architect of what comes next.</p>

      <p><strong>We welcome everyone:</strong> High school students studying economics, factory workers understanding
        automation firsthand, university researchers, software developers, truck drivers, retirees with decades of
        hard-won experience, community advocates, teachers, farmers, small business owners, veterans, nurses, and
        concerned citizens from every corner of the globe. You don't need advanced degrees or prestigious
        credentials—you need thoughtfulness, dedication, and a commitment to serving humanity.</p>

      <p>This is mission-driven work. Many contributors offer their time and expertise as an act of service to future
        generations, driven by purpose rather than compensation. In a world where jobs are automated away, <strong>your
          value comes from what you contribute to solving real problems</strong>—building systems that ensure economic
        dignity for everyone, regardless of what technology disrupts next.</p>

      <p><strong>How you can contribute:</strong> Review and critique proposals with your real-world experience, suggest
        improvements based on what you've lived through, help with technical implementation, translate content, share
        your perspective on what working people actually need, spread the word, or simply join the conversation. Every
        form of participation strengthens this initiative. The best ideas often come from those who've faced economic
        hardship directly, not from ivory tower theorists.</p>
